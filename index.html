                <h2>Poseidon</h2>
                <p>Neptune got its name from the equivalent of Poseidon in Greek mythology. The Roman god Neptune was the king of the ocean, and one of the big three (along with his brothers Jupiter and Pluto), so the choice comes because of the intense shade of blue that the planet presents.</p>

                <h2>Neptune</h2>
                <p>Neptune is a planet belonging to the Solar System. It is the eighth furthest from the Sun, which gives it very low temperatures, around -200 Â°C. The planet Neptune is classified as an ice giant due to its composition, which is made up of gases such as helium, methane, hydrogen and ammonia, and the absence of a solid surface.</p>
